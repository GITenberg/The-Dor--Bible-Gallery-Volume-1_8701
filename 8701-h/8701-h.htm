<p>This volume, as its title indicates, is a collection of
engravings illustrative of the Bible&mdash;the designs being all from
the pencil of the greatest of modern delineators, Gustave Dore.
The original work, from which this collection has been made, met
with an immediate and warm recognition and acceptance among those
whose means admitted of its purchase, and its popularity has in
no wise diminished since its first publication, but has even
extended to those who could only enjoy it casually, or in
fragmentary parts. That work, however, in its entirety, was far
too costly for the larger and ever-widening circle of M. Dore's
admirers, and to meet the felt and often-expressed want of this
class, and to provide a volume of choice and valuable designs
upon sacred subjects for art-loving Biblical students generally,
this work was projected and has been carried forward. The aim has
been to introduce subjects of general interest&mdash;that is, those
relating to the most prominent events and personages of
Scripture&mdash;those most familiar to all readers; the plates being
chosen with special reference to the known taste of the American
people. To each cut is prefixed a page of letter-press&mdash;in,
narrative form, and containing generally a brief analysis of the
design. Aside from the labors of the editor and publishers, the
work, while in progress, was under the pains-taking and careful
scrutiny of artists and scholars not directly interested in the
undertaking, but still having a generous solicitude for its
success. It is hoped, therefore, that its general plan and
execution will render it acceptable both to the appreciative and
friendly patrons of the great artist, and to those who would wish
to possess such a work solely as a choice collection of
illustrations upon sacred themes.</p>
<br><br><br><br>
<center><h2>GUSTAVE DORE.</h2></center>
<br>
<p>The subject of this sketch is, perhaps, the most original and
variously gifted designer the world has ever known. At an age
when most men have scarcely passed their novitiate in art, and
are still under the direction and discipline of their masters and
the schools, he had won a brilliant reputation, and readers and
scholars everywhere were gazing on his work with ever-increasing
wonder and delight at his fine fancy and multifarious gifts. He
has raised illustrative art to a dignity and importance before
unknown, and has developed capacities for the pencil before
unsuspected. He has laid all subjects tribute to his genius,
explored and embellished fields hitherto lying waste, and opened
new and shining paths and vistas where none before had trod. To
the works of the great he has added the lustre of his genius,
bringing their beauties into clearer view and warming them to a
fuller life.</p>

<p>His delineations of character, in the different phases of
life, from the horrible to the grotesque, the grand to the comic,
attest the versatility of his powers; and, whatever faults may be
found by critics, the public will heartily render their quota of
admiration to his magic touch, his rich and facile rendering of
almost every thought that stirs, or lies yet dormant, in the
human heart. It is useless to attempt a sketch of his various
beauties; those who would know them best must seek them in the
treasure&mdash;house that his genius is constantly augmenting with
fresh gems and wealth. To one, however, of his most prominent
traits we will refer&mdash;his wonderful rendering of the powers of
Nature.</p>

<p>His early wanderings in the wild and romantic passes of the
Vosges doubtless developed this inherent tendency of his mind.
There he wandered, and there, mayhap, imbibed that deep delight
of wood and valley, mountain&mdash;pass and rich ravine, whose variety
of form and detail seems endless to the enchanted eye. He has
caught the very spell of the wilderness; she has laid her hand
upon him, and he has gone forth with her blessing. So bold and
truthful and minute are his countless representations of forest
scenery; so delicate the tracery of branch and stem; so
patriarchal the giant boles of his woodland monarchs, that the'
gazer is at once satisfied and entranced. His vistas lie
slumbering with repose either in shadowy glade or fell ravine,
either with glint of lake or the glad, long course of some
rejoicing stream, and above all, supreme in a beauty all its own,
he spreads a canopy of peerless sky, or a wilderness, perhaps, of
angry storm, or peaceful stretches of soft, fleecy cloud, or
heavens serene and fair&mdash;another kingdom to his teeming art,
after the earth has rendered all her gifts.</p>

<p>Paul Gustave Dore was born in the city of Strasburg, January
10, 1833. Of his boyhood we have no very particular account. At
eleven years of age, however, he essayed his first artistic
creation&mdash;a set' of lithographs, published in his native city.
The following year found him in Paris, entered as a 7. student at
the Charlemagne Lyceum. His first actual work began in 1848, when
his fine series of sketches, the "Labors of Hercules," was given
to the public through the medium of an illustrated, journal with
which he was for a long time connected as designer. In 1856 were
published the illustrations for Balzac's "Contes Drolatiques" and
those for "The Wandering Jew "&mdash;the first humorous and grotesque
in the highest degree&mdash;indeed, showing a perfect abandonment to
fancy; the other weird and supernatural, with fierce battles,
shipwrecks, turbulent mobs, and nature in her most forbidding and
terrible aspects. Every incident or suggestion that could
possibly make the story more effective, or add to the horror of
the scenes was seized upon and portrayed with wonderful power.
These at once gave the young designer a great reputation, which
was still more enhanced by his subsequent works.</p>

<p>With all his love for nature and his power of interpreting her
in her varying moods, Dore was a dreamer, and many of his finest
achievements were in the realm of the imagination. But he was at
home in the actual world also, as witness his designs for
"Atala," "London&mdash;a Pilgrimage," and many of the scenes in "Don
Quixote."</p>

<p>When account is taken of the variety of his designs, and the
fact considered that in almost every task he attempted none had
ventured before him, the amount of work he accomplished is fairly
incredible. To enumerate the immense tasks he undertook&mdash;some
single volumes alone containing hundreds of illustrations&mdash;will
give some faint idea of his industry. Besides those already
mentioned are Montaigne, Dante, the Bible, Milton, Rabelais,
Tennyson's "Idyls of the King," "The Ancient Mariner,"
Shakespeare, "Legende de Croquemitaine," La Fontaine's "Fables,"
and others still.</p>

<p>Take one of these works&mdash;the Dante, La Fontaine, or "Don
Quixote"&mdash;and glance at the pictures. The mere hand labor
involved in their production is surprising; but when the quality
of the work is properly estimated, what he accomplished seems
prodigious. No particular mention need be made of him as painter
or sculptor, for his reputation rests solely upon his work as an
illustrator.</p>

<p>Dore's nature was exuberant and buoyant, and he was youthful
in appearance. He had a passion for music, possessed rare skill
as a violinist, and it is assumed that, had he failed to succeed
with his pencil, he could have won a brilliant reputation as a
musician.</p>

<p>He was a bachelor, and lived a quiet, retired life with his
mother&mdash;married, as he expressed it, to her and his art. His
death occurred on January 23, 1883.</p>

<h2>THE CREATION OF EVE.</h2>

<p>"And the Lord God said, it is not good that the man should be
alone; I will make him a helpmeet for him. And the Lord God
caused a deep sleep to fall on Adam, and he slept, and he took
one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof; and the
rib which the Lord God had taken from man, made he a woman, and
brought her unto the man. And Adam said, This is now bone of my
bone and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because
she was taken out of man. Therefore shall a man leave his father
and mother, and shall cleave unto his wife, and they shall be one
flesh." Genesis ii, 18, 21-24.</p>

<p>In these few words the Scriptures narrate the creation of the
first mother of our race. In "Paradise Lost," the poetic genius
of Milton, going more into detail, describes how Eve awoke to
consciousness, and found herself reposing under a shade of
flowers, much wondering what she was and whence she came.
Wandering by the margin of a small lake, she sees her own form
mirrored in the clear waters, at which she wonders more. But a
voice is heard, leading her to him for whom she was made, who
lies sleeping under a grateful shade. It is at this point the
artist comes to interpret the poet's dream. Amid the varied and
luxurious foliage of Eden, in the vague light of the early dawn,
Eve is presented, coy and graceful, gazing on her sleeping Lord,
while in the background is faintly outlined the mystic form of
Him in whose image they were created.</p>

<p>And the Lord God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us,
to know good and evil; and now, lest he put forth his hand, and
take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live forever:
Therefore, the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden,
to till the ground from whence he was taken. So he drove out the
man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden cherubims,
and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of
the tree of life.&mdash;Genesis iii, 22-24</p>

<p>They, looking back, all the eastern side beheld Of Paradise,
so late their happy seat, Waved over by that flaming brand; the
gate, With dreadful forces thronged, and fiery arms Some natural
tears they dropped, but wiped them soon; The world was all before
them, where to choose Their place of rest, and Providence their
guide; They, hand in hand, with wandering steps and slow, Through
Eden took their solitary way.</p>

<p>And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain,
and said, I have gotten a man from the Lord. And she again bare
his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a
tiller of the ground. And in process of time it came to pass,
that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the
Lord. And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock
and of the fat thereof. And the Lord had respect unto Abel and to
his offering: But unto Cain and to his offering he had not
respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell. And
the Lord said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy
countenance fallen? If thou doest well, shalt thou not be
accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door, and
unto thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him. And
Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass,&mdash;when
they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his
brother, and slew him.</p>

<p>And the Lord said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he
said, I know not Am I my brother's keeper? And he said, What hast
thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from
the ground. And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath
opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand;
When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto
thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the
earth. And Cain said unto the Lord, My punishment is greater than
I can bear. Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the
face of the earth and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall
be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to
pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me. And the Lord
said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall
be taken on him sevenfold. And the Lord set a mark upon Cain,
lest any finding him should kill him.</p>

<p>And Cain went out from the presence of the Lord, and dwelt in
the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.&mdash;Genesis iv, 1-16</p>

<p>In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month,
the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the
fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven
were opened. And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty
nights.</p>

<p>In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and
Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three wives
of his sons with them, into the ark; they, and every beast after
his kind, and all the cattle after their kind, and every creeping
thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind, and every fowl
after his kind, every bird of every sort. And they went in unto
Noah into the ark, two and two of all flesh, wherein is the
breath of life. And they that went in, went in male and female of
all flesh, as God had commanded him: and the Lord shut him
in.</p>

<p>And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters
increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the
earth. And the waters prevailed, and were increased, greatly upon
the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters. And the
waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high
hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered. Fifteen
cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains were
covered. And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of
fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing
that creepeth upon the earth, and every man; all in whose
nostrils was the breath of life, of all that was in the dry land,
died. And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the
face of the ground, both man and cattle, and the creeping things,
and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the
earth; and Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him
in the ark.</p>

<p>And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty
days.&mdash;Genesis vii, 11-24.</p>

<p>And the sons of Noah, that went forth of the ark, were Shem,
and Ham, and Japheth; and Ham is the father of Canaan. These are
the three sons of Noah: and of them was the whole earth
overspread.</p>

<p>And Noah began to be an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard:
And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered
within his tent. And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness
of his father, and told his two brethren without. And Shem and
Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders,
and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and
their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's
nakedness. And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his
younger son had done unto him. And he said, Cursed be Canaan; a
servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren. And he said,
Blessed be the Lord God of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.
God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of
Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.&mdash;Genesis ix, 18-27.</p>

<p>And the whole earth was of one language, and of one
speech.</p>

<p>And it came to pass as they journeyed from the east, that they
found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there. And
they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn them
thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for
mortar. And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower,
whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest
we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.</p>

<p>And the Lord came down to see the city and the tower which the
children of men builded. And the Lord said, Behold, the people is
one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do:
and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have
imagined to do. Go to, let us go down, and there confound their
language, that they may not understand one another's speech.</p>

<p>So the Lord scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of
all the earth: and they left off to build the city.</p>

<p>Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the Lord did
there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did
the Lord scatter them abroad upon the face of all the
earth.&mdash;Genesis xi, 1-9.</p>

<p>In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his
son. And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought
with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him.</p>

<p>And the Lord appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre: and he
sat in the tent door in the heat of the day; and he lift up his
eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw
them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself
toward the ground, and said, My Lord, if now I have found favour
in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant: let a
little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and
rest yourselves under the tree: And I will fetch a morsel of
bread, and comfort ye your hearts; after that ye shall pass on:
for therefore are ye come to your servant. And they said, So do,
as thou hast said.</p>

<p>And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make
ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make
cakes upon the hearth. And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetched
a calf tender and good, and gave it unto a young man; and he
hasted to dress it. And he took butter, and milk, and the calf
which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by
them under the tree, and they did eat.&mdash;Genesis xvii, 26, 27;
xviii 1-8.</p>

<p>Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some have
entertained angels unawares.&mdash;Hebrews xiii, 2.</p>

<p>And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot,
saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are
here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city. And
while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the
hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the
Lord being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set
him without the city.</p>

<p>And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad,
that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither
stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be
consumed. And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my Lord. Behold
now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast
magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my
life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me
and I die. Behold now this city is near to flee unto, and it is a
little one: Oh, let me escape thither (is it not a little one?)
and my soul shall live. And he said unto him, See, I have
accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not
overthrow this city, for the which thou hast spoken. Haste thee,
escape thither; for I cannot do anything till thou be come
thither.</p>

<p>Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.</p>

<p>The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered unto Zoar.
Then the Lord rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and
fire from the Lord out of heaven; and he overthrew those cities,
and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and
that which grew upon the ground.</p>

<p>But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a
pillar of salt.</p>

<p>And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he
stood before the Lord and he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah,
and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and lo, the
smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.&mdash;Genesis
xix, 15-28.</p>

<p>And the Lord visited Sarah as he had said, and the Lord did
unto Sarah as he had spoken. For Sarah conceived, and bare
Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had
spoken to him. And Abraham called the name of his son that was
born unto him, whom Sarah bare to him, Isaac. And Abraham
circumcised his son Isaac, being eight days old, as God had
commanded him. And Abraham was an hundred years old, when his son
Isaac was born unto him.</p>

<p>And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh, so that all that
hear will laugh with me. And she said, Who would have said unto
Abraham, that Sarah should have given children suck? for I have
born him a son in his old age. And the child grew, and was
weaned: and Abraham made a great feast the same day that Isaac
was weaned.</p>

<p>And Sarah, saw the son of Hagar, the Egyptian, which she had
born unto Abraham, mocking. Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast
out this bondwoman and her son; for the son of this, bondwoman
shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac.</p>

<p>And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight because of
his son. And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy
sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all
that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in
Isaac shall thy seed be called. And also of the son of the
bondwoman will I make a nation, because he is thy seed.</p>

<p>And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and
a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her
shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and
wandered in the wilderness of Beer-sheba.&mdash;Genesis xxi, 1-14.</p>

<p>And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and
a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her
shoulder, and the child, and sent her away; and she departed, and
wandered in the wilderness of Beer-sheba. And the water was spent
in the bottle, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs.
And she went and sat her down over against him a good way off, as
it were a bow-shot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the
child. And she sat over against him, and lifted up her voice and
wept. And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God
called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth
thee, Hagar? fear not, for God hath heard the voice of the lad
where he is. Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand;
for I will make him a great nation. And God opened her eyes, and
she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with
water, and gave the lad drink. And God was with the lad; and he
grew, and dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer. And he
dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him a wife
out of the land of Egypt.&mdash;Genesis xxi. 14-21.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
